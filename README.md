# Next Forum
A text-based forum that allows users to register, login, upload posts, comment and like/dislike.

The original forum project was created in Go - I'm currently in the process of transporting it to Typscript/Next JS in order to practice using Javascript frameworks as well as front-end website design. This is a work in progress and, as of 16/01/2024, does not run.
